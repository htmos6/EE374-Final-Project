# EE374-Final-Project
EE374-final-project-phase-1 & phase-2 solutions.
According to the given data, the necessary parameters of the
high voltage transmission lines are calculated. 
Explanations of the project are given in the

EE374_2022_Spring_Project_Definition.pdf documentation.

First phase calculates S_base, V_base, N_circuit, N_bundle,
d_bundle, length, conductor_name, R_ac, outside_diameter, GMR_conductor.

The second phase calculates resistance, reactance, and shunt capacitance.
